Within this project folder, I hope to establish a well-organized system for cleaning and analyzing the data for my thesis project. The survey was sent out this week, so I will have data to start cleaning and working with in the next month. 

Therefore, this project houses the beginning of my literature review for now. In the future, it will include all data for my thesis, which will be completed over the summer.
