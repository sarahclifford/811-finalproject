# Final Project

This repository contains information for the final project in PS811. It contains the beginning of my thesis literature review, as data is forthcoming. My survey was sent out this week, so data will be loaded into the project in the future. The primary exercise I performed for this class's final project was therefore not data focused, but instead on writing in .Rmd and using the .bib function to generate a reference list.
